Otis is a mix of **Bearded Collie, Border Collie, Jack Russell Terrier, and Norwegian Elkhound**, or BCBCJRTNE for short. I had him for a week-long stay.

His favorite activities were:

- Sleeping like a Burrito

- Sleeping like a Potato

- Walking up to my bed and waking me up at 6 AM with this face
