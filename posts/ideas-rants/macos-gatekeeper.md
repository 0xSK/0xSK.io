MacOS: App is damaged and can't be opened.

me: `xattr -c /Applications/Awesome.app`

MacOS: App cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.

me: *\*right-click > Open\**

MacOS: *Awesome.app* is an app downloaded from the Internet. 
Are you sure you want to open it?

me: *\*Open\**

*\*App opens magically.\**
